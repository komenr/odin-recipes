Napa cabbage and Korean radish are the most common and widely known vegetables used to make kimchi, but there are hundreds of different types of kimchi, made from a variety of vegetables.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ tbsp Vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 eggs lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1½ cups kimchi chopped</li>
            <li>3 tbsp soy sauce low sodium</li>
            <li>3 green onions thinly sliced and divided</li>
            <li>2½ cups steamed rice</li>
            <li>2 tsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cooking process:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place all pork marinade ingredients into a mixing bowl and whisk together. Add pork and mix together. Set aside and allow pork to marinate for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 tablespoon vegetable oil into a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add pork and saute for 4 to 5 minutes or until browned and just cooked through. Remove from skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour remaining vegetable oil into skillet followed by beaten eggs. As eggs cook, gently but quickly cook, stir and break apart into large pieces. Remove from heat and add to cooked pork belly.</li>
            <li>Pour sesame oil into skillet. Add kimchi and soy sauce and saute until kimchi begins to caramelize, 3 to 4 minutes. Add rice and stir together until rice is well coated. Add pork belly and eggs back to the skillet and toss together until evenly distributed through rice mixture. Continue to cook until rice begins to char around edges, about 4 to 5 minutes, then toss together again.</li>
            <li>Stir 2 sliced green onions and sesame seeds and remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining green onion and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
