        <p>The <strong>BEST</strong> Mongolian Beef Recipe you will ever taste! </p>
        <p>A quick, easy and ridiculously delicious stir fry dish of tender beef coated in a slightly sweet and savory sauce, Inspired by P.F. Changs Mongolian beef recipe. Serve it over steamed rice and a side of sautéed or steamed veggies for a complete meal everyone will love! Mongolian beef is a popular stir-fry beef dish, made in a wok, served in Chinese restaurants. It was created in Taiwan, during the 1950’s, when Chinese BBQ was becoming a trendy cuisine. Its most notable trait is the tenderized slices of beef simmered together in a sweet and savory sauce.

            The name of the dish refers to Mongolian barbecue style of cooking, which is quick and over high heat. The dish itself isn’t actually associated with Mongolian cuisine.
